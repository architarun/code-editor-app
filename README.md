# Online Code Editor using React

This is my first project using React and Node.js. So I had to learn t from scratch and thus this project was a learning process and took around 2 days. The first day was basically used for revising the basics of Node.js and learning React. I made the initial version of the code editor based on a tutuorial from Web Dev Simplified. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
