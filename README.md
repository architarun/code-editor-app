# Online Code Editor using React

This is my submission for Dyte placement process.

This is my first project using React and Node.js. So I had to learn t from scratch and thus this project was a learning process and took around 2 days. The first day was basically used for revising the basics of Node.js and learning React. I made the initial version of the code editor based on a tutuorial from Web Dev Simplified. 

Unfortunately I was unable to implement the file directory kind of setup where the user chooses the file(HTML,CSS or JS) he/she wants to edit and and the other code editor panel changes dynamicaly due to the deadline.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
