# Online Code Editor Using React


An online code editor using React


This is my first project using React. It is part of the recruitment process at Dyte where we are supposed to submit a project in one oth domains they were recruiting for (Frontend, Backend and Design)

I haven't work with React nor Node.js in much extent. So this was more a learning as I worked on this kind of project. The whole project took around 2 days to complete; most of the 1st day went by revising the basic concepts of Node.js and coding with React. I made the intial version of the code editor based on a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified and then tailored it to fit the requirements set by Dyte for their projects.
